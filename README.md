# BioSEPBERT
This repository provides the code for BioSEPBERT, a neuroscience representation model designed for Brain Region text mining tasks such as named entity recognition and relation extraction.
# Download
We provide two versions of pre-trained weights.
-[BioSEPBERT-NER](http://brainsmatics.org/) - fine-tuning on WhiteText corpus
-[BioSEPBERT-RE](http://brainsmatics.org/) - fine-tuning on WhiteText connectivity corpus
# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Datasets
We provide a pre-processed version of benchmark datasets for each task as follows:
Named Entity Recognition: (36.3 MB), a dataset on brain region named entity recognition
Relation Extraction: (118.6 MB), 2 datasets on brain region connectivity relation extraction
You can simply get all these on the datasets folder.
